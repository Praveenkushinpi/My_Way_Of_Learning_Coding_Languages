## A variable is like a container that stores a value â€” such as a number, a word, or anything else you want to use in your code.


### Ways to declare Variables 
1. `var` - old way (avoid in modern code )
   
   ```js
   var name= "name";
   ```

2. `let` - modern, changeable value

   ```js
   let score = 20;
   score = 20 ; // you can update it
   ```
3. `const` - moder, fixed value
   ```
    const pi=3.14 
   // pi = 314159 ; Error ! you can't change a const value
    ```
 ## Variables Naming Rules

. Letters (`a-z`,`A-Z`)

. Numbers 

. `_` and `$`

### Not Allowed
