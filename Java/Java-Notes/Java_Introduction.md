##  Java Introduction

## Introduction to Java

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). It is widely used for applications like mobile apps, web development, game development, and enterprise software.

## Key Features of Java

1. **Platform Independence** - "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) using Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
2. **Object-Oriented** - Supports Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
3. **Simple & Readable** - Similar to C++ but removes complexities like pointers.
4. **Secure & Robust** - Built-in security and exception handling.
5. **Automatic Memory Management** - Uses Garbage Collection.
6. **Multithreading Support** - Runs multiple threads concurrently.

## Basic Java Program

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

## How Java Works

1. **Write Code (.java file)** - Example: `HelloWorld.java`
2. **Compile (`javac HelloWorld.java`)** - Converts Java code into bytecode (`.class` file).
3. **Run (`java HelloWorld`)** - JVM executes the bytecode.

## Common Uses of Java

- Android App Development
- Web Development (Spring, Hibernate, JSP, Servlets)
- Game Development (LibGDX, jMonkeyEngine, Minecraft modding)
- Enterprise Applications

## Next Steps

1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK)
2. Set up a Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
3. Learn Java OOP concepts
4. Explore APIs (e.g., Minecraft Forge for modding)
