# Let's start our HTML journey by making our first website 
### open vs code

Click on new file and name it My_website.html You can name it anything but make sure to place .html after anything 
.html is like a name plate for your html file so that our browser read it as a html code and show us our beautiful website

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```
this is a boiler plate code which you don't have to type just click `shift + !` and yipee you got your first html code 
## so you might br wondering we are doing coding and what we see is things like <head> and <body> inside weired hands but these are the most important things in HTML 
### before we start lets start introduction line by line 
## 1   ` <!DOCTYPE html> ` it is like your file is saying to browser that hello i am written in latest html 
## 2   ` <html lang="en"> ` it is like your file is saying that i am written in english 
## 3   ` <head> ` this pleace is like a secret spot where you can place things which can not be seen directly but still plays a ceucial role in our website
## 4   ` <meta charset="UTF-8"> ` this tell the browser to use UTF-8 which supports all text as well as emojis 
## 5   ` <title> ` is used to name your website 
## 6   ` <body> ` is used to code everything we want in our website
