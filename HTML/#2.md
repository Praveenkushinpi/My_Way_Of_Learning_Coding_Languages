<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

    <title>Portfolio</title> <--- NAME YOUR WEBSITE 
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```
## step 1 
  for writing Hello World we are going to use Heading `<h1>` tag so in html 
  there is one opening tag and another closing tag so if you opens up a tag `<>` so you also have to close it `</>`
